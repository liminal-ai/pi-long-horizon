# Test Plan: Session Context Store

## Purpose

This test plan maps every Test Condition from Epic 1 to a concrete test file and behavior. It is the authoritative TC-to-test matrix for Session Context Store implementation. The tech design index explains architecture and interfaces; this document tells implementers exactly where confidence comes from.

Feature 1 has 78 epic TCs. This plan maps each TC to one primary test. It also adds 13 non-TC decided tests for implementation risks that are not captured one-to-one in the epic.

## Test Architecture

Tests follow the service-mock philosophy. Enter through public Context Steward services and PI command handlers, exercise internal modules together, and mock only external boundaries.

| Boundary | Test Treatment |
|---|---|
| Filesystem store | Use real temp directories for store/service tests. This is core behavior, not an external service to mock away. |
| PI extension event payloads | Use typed fixtures that match `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` event shapes. |
| PI native session files | Use compact fixture JSONL/session-entry builders and `pi-session-importer` tests. |
| PI UI notifications | Fake `ctx.ui.notify` and assert code/summary rendering. |
| Internal services | Do not mock in service-level tests. Wiring is part of the behavior. |

Primary test locations:

```text
tests/context-steward/
  foundation.test.ts
  thread-store.test.ts
  capture-service.test.ts
  turn-service.test.ts
  import-service.test.ts
  repair-service.test.ts
  fixture-service.test.ts
  pi-extension-commands.test.ts
  file-thread-store.integration.test.ts
```

## Mock and Fixture Strategy

Fixtures should live in `src/context-steward/test/fixtures.ts` for reusable builders and in `tests/fixtures/pi-sessions/` for file-shaped PI session samples.

Required builders:

| Builder | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `makeThreadTarget()` | PI target metadata with session id, file path, and cwd. |
| `makePiUserMessage()` | Finalized agent-addressed prompt event. |
| `makePiAssistantMessage()` | Finalized assistant response with text, reasoning, and tool calls. |
| `makePiToolResultMessage()` | Finalized toolResult message. |
| `makeRuntimeNoteActivity()` | Canonical runtime-note activity for state-affecting events. |
| `makeThreadSnapshot()` | Store snapshot with configurable messages/turns. |
| `makePiSessionEntries()` | Active-path import fixtures with optional branches. |
| `withTempThreadStore()` | Creates isolated `.context-steward` temp root and cleans it up. |

## TC Mapping

### `thread-store.test.ts`

This file is the entry point for persistence rules that do not need PI runtime behavior to be meaningful. It proves thread creation, schema gating, actor reuse, append-only source invariants, and target metadata ownership against the real file-backed store.

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TC-1.1a | creates source thread for new managed PI session | Empty temp store | `openOrCreateManagedThread` | Thread has unique id, `pi` target, schema version, no messages |
| TC-1.1b | opens existing source thread without duplicate | Store has associated Thread | `openOrCreateManagedThread` same target | Same thread id returned; only one active association |
| TC-1.1c | reports store unavailable on session start | Store root made unwritable or fake store throws | `openOrCreateManagedThread` | `STORE_UNAVAILABLE`; no Thread created |
| TC-1.2a | records PI target metadata | New/open Thread target includes session id/path | Read Thread | Target runtime, session id, generated path if supplied |
| TC-1.2b | reads source messages from canonical records | Thread has generated file path and canonical messages | `readMessages` | Messages come from `messages.jsonl`, not generated path |
| TC-1.3a | allows mutation for supported schema | Thread at v1 schema | Append message/write turns | Write succeeds |
| TC-1.3b | blocks mutation for unsupported schema | Thread schema manually set to future version | Append message/write turns | `UNSUPPORTED_SCHEMA_VERSION` |
| TC-1.4a | declares unknown actor before message reference | Capture message with new actor | Append message | Actor exists and message references actor id/type |
| TC-1.4b | reuses existing actor | Store has actor | Append second message from same actor | No duplicate actor; message references same actor |
| TC-2.3a | turn close does not mutate message content | Message belongs to open turn | Close turn via next prompt/writeTurns | Original message fields unchanged |
| TC-2.3b | repair does not mutate message content | Stored messages with broken turns | Run repair | Message content/source order unchanged |
| TC-4.1a | records generated PI session file path | Thread exists | `updateGeneratedSessionMetadata(path)` | `target.currentGeneratedFilePath` set |
| TC-4.1b | represents missing generated path explicitly | Thread has no generated path | Read target metadata | Field absent/undefined and status object says none |
| TC-4.1c | represents absent projection revisions | Thread has no projection records | `readProjectionRevisions` | Empty array, not error |
| TC-4.2a | keeps target session id separate from thread id | Thread target has PI session id | Read Thread identity | `threadId` and `target.sessionId` both visible |
| TC-4.2b | generated file path does not define source order | Thread has generated path and messages | `readMessages` | Order follows `sourceOrder` |
| TC-4.2c | reads projection metadata without source-file import | Thread has projection metadata | Read Thread/projections | Metadata available without reading generated file content |

### `capture-service.test.ts`

These tests exercise the capture seam where PI-finalized activity becomes canonical source history. They intentionally enter through `capture-service` so the PI mapper, duplicate detection, source-order assignment, and partial degradation logic are tested together.

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TC-2.1a | captures finalized prompt | Managed Thread, PI user message | `captureFinalizedActivity` | Prompt message with actor, kind, timestamp, source order, parts, target metadata |
| TC-2.1b | captures finalized agent response | Managed Thread, PI assistant message | Capture | Response message with ordered text/reasoning/tool parts |
| TC-2.1c | captures finalized tool result | Managed Thread, PI toolResult message | Capture | Tool result message with tool metadata and parts |
| TC-2.1d | captures relevant runtime note | Managed Thread, runtime note activity | Capture | Runtime event message with runtime-note part |
| TC-2.1e | preserves rapid finalized event order | Two events queued for same Thread | Capture both sequentially through write queue | Distinct increasing source orders matching observed order |
| TC-2.1f | ignores duplicate finalized event | Existing message indexed by targetEventKey | Capture same targetEventKey | `CAPTURE_DUPLICATE_EVENT`; no appended duplicate |
| TC-2.2a | preserves multiple part order | PI message with text, reasoning, tool call | Map/capture | Parts have semantic order and partOrder 1..n |
| TC-2.2b | stores supported content as typed parts | PI message includes all supported content fixtures | Map/capture | Part types are specific: text/reasoning/tool_call/tool_result/runtime_note/image_ref/file_ref |
| TC-2.2c | reports unsupported part type visibly | PI message contains unknown custom content | Map/capture | `UNMAPPED_PART_TYPE`; source content preserved as unknown or rejected with issue |
| TC-2.4a | reports append failure with activity context | Store append throws | Capture finalized PI message | `CAPTURE_APPEND_FAILED` includes target, actor, kind, timestamp, cause |
| TC-2.4b | failed append is not marked captured | Store append throws | Read Thread | No successful source record for failed activity |

### `turn-service.test.ts`

This file focuses on prompt-bounded grouping rules rather than raw persistence. The goal is to show that open/closed turn lifecycle, pre-turn handling, and multi-response/tool-cycle membership are all consequences of one consistent boundary rule.

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TC-3.1a | first prompt opens first canonical turn | Thread has no turns | Capture agent-addressed prompt | One open turn with prompt as initiating message |
| TC-3.1b | next prompt closes previous turn | Thread has open turn | Capture next prompt | Previous turn closed; new open turn created |
| TC-3.2a | response joins open turn | Thread has open turn | Capture response | Response message id in open turn |
| TC-3.2b | tool activity joins open turn | Thread has open turn | Capture tool call/result activity | Tool activity associated with same turn |
| TC-3.2c | runtime note joins open turn | Thread has open turn | Capture relevant runtime note | Runtime note associated with same turn |
| TC-3.3a | multiple responses stay in one turn | Open turn | Capture multiple assistant responses | All response ids in same turn in source order |
| TC-3.3b | multiple tool cycles stay in one turn | Open turn | Capture multiple tool result cycles | All tool ids in same turn in source order |
| TC-3.4a | records open turn status | Prompt captured, no later prompt | Read turns | Turn status `open` with current message ids |
| TC-3.4b | records closed turn status | Two prompts captured | Read first turn | Turn status `closed` with final member ids |
| TC-3.5a | retains pre-turn runtime note | Runtime note before first prompt | Capture/read | Message stored and absent from turn membership |
| TC-3.5b | reports pre-turn source record range | Thread has pre-turn message | `checkTurnHealth` | Report includes pre-turn source range |

### `import-service.test.ts`

Attach/import is its own seam because it has to reconcile two histories: PI's native active path and the steward's canonical Thread. These tests verify active-path resolution, canonical mapping, import metadata, and the handoff back to normal live capture rules.

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TC-5.1a | imports existing PI session into new Thread | PI session fixture with prior activity, no Thread | `/lh-attach` core service | New Thread with imported canonical messages |
| TC-5.1b | attaches empty existing PI session | Empty PI session fixture, no Thread | Attach/import | New Thread with import metadata count 0 |
| TC-5.1c | rejects duplicate attach | Target already associated with Thread | Attach same target as new | `TARGET_ASSOCIATION_CONFLICT`; no duplicate Thread |
| TC-5.2a | imports active branch path only | Branched session with resolvable leaf | Attach/import | Imported messages match active path; metadata records path reference |
| TC-5.2b | rejects ambiguous branch path | Branched session without active path | Attach/import | `IMPORT_PATH_AMBIGUOUS`; no messages appended |
| TC-5.3a | preserves imported order | PI session with multiple entries | Attach/import | Canonical sourceOrder matches active path order |
| TC-5.3b | preserves imported parts | PI session with supported content types | Attach/import | Imported message parts typed and ordered |
| TC-5.3c | preserves imported metadata | PI entries include timestamp/ids | Attach/import | Timestamp and PI target metadata stored |
| TC-5.4a | records import source metadata | Successful import | Read Thread imports | Source session/path, time, source range, count, status |
| TC-5.4b | distinguishes imported range from later capture | Import then live capture | Read imports/messages | Imported range identifies prior messages; later sourceOrder outside range |
| TC-5.5a | imported prompts create turns | Imported history with prompts | Attach/import | Each prompt starts canonical turn |
| TC-5.5b | imported responses join prompt turns | Imported prompt/response/tool sequence | Attach/import | Responses/tool activity assigned between prompt boundaries |
| TC-5.5c | reports incomplete imported turn reconstruction | Imported history with ambiguous prompt status | Attach/import | Import partial; affected turns `repair_needed`; thread turnState `repair_needed` |
| TC-5.6a | appends new activity after imported range | Attach complete | Capture live activity | New sourceOrder after imported range |
| TC-5.6b | applies turn semantics after import | Imported Thread has open/closed state | Capture next prompt | Same prompt-bounded rules apply |
| TC-5.6c | prevents import overlapping active live capture | Live capture active for target | Attach same target as new Thread | `TARGET_ASSOCIATION_CONFLICT`; active Thread unchanged |

### `repair-service.test.ts`

Repair tests prove the feature's key recovery contract: immutable source messages can outlive broken turn state. They enter through `repair-service` and `turn-service` health checks so stale-source guards, ambiguous-boundary handling, and readiness blocking are visible at the same abstraction level operators will use.

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TC-6.1a | detects missing turn state | Messages exist, no turns | `checkTurnHealth` | `TURN_STATE_MISSING` with affected range |
| TC-6.1b | detects incomplete turn membership | Turns omit expected message ids | Health check | `TURN_STATE_INCOMPLETE` and uncovered range |
| TC-6.1c | passes healthy turn state | Messages covered by valid turns | Health check | Status ready |
| TC-6.2a | repair creates turns from prompts | Messages with prompts, no turns | `repairTurnState` | Turns created at prompt boundaries |
| TC-6.2b | repair assigns between-boundary messages | Messages between two prompts | Repair | Between-boundary messages assigned to first prompt turn |
| TC-6.2c | repair preserves final open turn | Last prompt has no later prompt | Repair | Final turn status `open` |
| TC-6.3a | repair preserves source order | Ordered messages | Repair | Message sourceOrder unchanged |
| TC-6.3b | repair preserves message content | Messages with full fields | Repair | Content, parts, actor, kind, timestamps, metadata unchanged |
| TC-6.4a | missing turn state blocks readiness | Missing turns | `checkMaintenanceReadiness` | Blocked; blocker names missing turn state |
| TC-6.4b | incomplete turn state blocks readiness | Incomplete membership | Readiness check | Blocked; affected range identified |
| TC-6.4c | repaired state clears blocker | Repair completed | Readiness check | No turn-state blocker for repaired range |
| TC-6.5a | reports ambiguous prompt boundary | Message cannot be classified as prompt/non-prompt | Repair | `TURN_REPAIR_AMBIGUOUS`; affected state not ready |
| TC-6.5b | reports repair write failure | Store refuses writeTurns | Repair | `TURN_REPAIR_WRITE_FAILED`; readiness remains blocked |
| TC-6.5c | rejects stale repair input | Source revision changes during repair | Repair write | `STALE_SOURCE_REVISION`; state not marked ready |

### `fixture-service.test.ts`

Fixture creation is the bridge from live dogfooding into repeatable downstream validation. These tests verify that a fixture remains Thread-shaped data, not a bespoke export format, and that import/repair state survives into that fixture view.

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TC-7.1a | creates fixture from managed Thread | Managed Thread with messages/turns | `createRealSessionFixture` | Fixture dir has Thread-shaped records and FixtureRecord |
| TC-7.1b | creates fixture from PI session import | PI session without managed Thread | Fixture via import | Fixture dir has imported canonical records and import metadata |
| TC-7.1c | reports fixture creation failure | Source unreadable/unconvertible | Create fixture | `FIXTURE_CREATE_FAILED` with source and cause |
| TC-7.2a | preserves fixture message order | Source Thread ordered messages | Create fixture | Fixture messages same canonical order |
| TC-7.2b | preserves fixture part structure | Source messages with ordered parts | Create fixture | Fixture preserves part type and part order |
| TC-7.3a | marks healthy fixture ready | Source turn state ready | Create fixture | FixtureRecord repairStatus `ready` |
| TC-7.3b | marks incomplete fixture repair-needed | Source turn state incomplete | Create fixture | FixtureRecord repairStatus `repair_needed` and affected range issue |
| TC-7.4a | records managed-thread fixture metadata | Fixture from managed Thread | Read `fixture.json` | Source type, thread id, created time, range, status |
| TC-7.4b | records PI-session fixture metadata | Fixture from PI session | Read `fixture.json` | Source session/path, import status, repair status, status |

## Command Tests

Command tests are secondary coverage over the same core behavior. They are not part of the 78-row primary TC reconciliation table below unless a story intentionally chooses a command as the primary verification entry point. The baseline 91-test count includes only the explicitly enumerated 13 non-TC tests in the next section.

| Test File | Test Name | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `pi-extension-commands.test.ts` | `/lh-attach` renders success and conflict summaries | Verifies command delegation and operator output. |
| `pi-extension-commands.test.ts` | `/lh-turn-health` renders ready and blocked states | Verifies health reports are operator-visible. |
| `pi-extension-commands.test.ts` | `/lh-repair-turns` renders repair success and stale-source failure | Verifies repair errors are not hidden. |
| `pi-extension-commands.test.ts` | `/lh-fixture` renders created fixture id and failure code | Verifies fixture command output. |
| `pi-extension-commands.test.ts` | `/lh-status` reports active Thread id and turn state | Verifies basic dogfood status command. |

## Non-TC Decided Tests

These tests are required by design risk, not by a single epic TC.

| ID | Test File | Test Name |
|---|---|---|
| NTC-1 | `foundation.test.ts` | id and content fingerprint helpers are deterministic |
| NTC-2 | `foundation.test.ts` | schema-version constants match thread initialization |
| NTC-3 | `thread-store.test.ts` | atomic metadata rewrite leaves prior file intact on failed temp write |
| NTC-4 | `thread-store.test.ts` | duplicate target index rebuilds from existing messages on startup |
| NTC-5 | `capture-service.test.ts` | signature-only reasoning block is preserved without invented text |
| NTC-6 | `capture-service.test.ts` | append succeeds but turn write fails and thread degrades to `repair_needed` without losing the source message |
| NTC-7 | `capture-service.test.ts` | tool execution lifecycle events are ignored unless finalized into messages or runtime notes |
| NTC-8 | `import-service.test.ts` | import dry run reports active path without writing records |
| NTC-9 | `import-service.test.ts` | partial import issues are sorted by source order |
| NTC-10 | `repair-service.test.ts` | range-limited repair does not rewrite unaffected turns |
| NTC-11 | `repair-service.test.ts` | health report ranges are sorted by source order |
| NTC-12 | `pi-extension-commands.test.ts` | command formatter returns concise success and error summaries |
| NTC-13 | `pi-extension-commands.test.ts` | `/lh-status` works when no managed Thread exists |

## Chunk Test Counts

| Chunk | Primary TC Tests | Non-TC Tests | Total |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Chunk 0: Foundation | 0 | 2 | 2 |
| Chunk 1: Thread, Actor, Message, and Target Metadata Store | 17 | 2 | 19 |
| Chunk 2: Live PI Activity Capture and Turn Lifecycle | 22 | 3 | 25 |
| Chunk 3: Attach and Import Existing PI Sessions | 16 | 2 | 18 |
| Chunk 4: Turn Health and Repair | 14 | 2 | 16 |
| Chunk 5: Real-Session Fixtures and Commands | 9 | 2 | 11 |
| Total | 78 | 13 | 91 |

## Verification Commands

| Gate | Command | Expected Use |
|---|---|---|
| `red-verify` | `npm run typecheck` | Run after Red tests are written but expected to fail. |
| `verify` | `npm run typecheck && npm run test` | Standard development gate. |
| `green-verify` | `npm run verify && npm run guard:no-test-changes` | Run after implementation passes and Red tests should remain unchanged. |
| `verify-all` | `npm run verify && npm run test:integration` | Run for story completion and before release. |

Integration tests should start with filesystem/import smoke coverage:

| Test File | Test Name | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `file-thread-store.integration.test.ts` | managed Thread survives process-style reopen | Verifies real file layout can be reopened from disk. |
| `file-thread-store.integration.test.ts` | PI session fixture imports through file path | Verifies import works against JSONL-shaped session fixture. |
| `file-thread-store.integration.test.ts` | concurrent capture requests serialize by source order | Verifies the per-thread write queue preserves canonical ordering under overlapping calls. |
| `file-thread-store.integration.test.ts` | stale temp metadata file does not replace the last committed snapshot | Verifies crash cleanup preserves the last known good state. |

## Count Reconciliation

The epic contains 78 TCs. This plan maps 78 primary TC tests. Non-TC decided tests add 13 tests. The planned Feature 1 total is therefore 91 tests.

Per-file primary TC counts:

This table is intentionally primary-TC-only. `foundation.test.ts` and `pi-extension-commands.test.ts` are omitted because they do not own primary epic TCs; they contribute to the separately counted non-TC baseline instead.

| Test File | Primary TC Tests |
|---|---:|
| `thread-store.test.ts` | 17 |
| `capture-service.test.ts` | 11 |
| `turn-service.test.ts` | 11 |
| `import-service.test.ts` | 16 |
| `repair-service.test.ts` | 14 |
| `fixture-service.test.ts` | 9 |
| Total | 78 |

Per-chunk primary TC totals also sum to 78. Per-chunk totals including non-TC tests sum to 91.
