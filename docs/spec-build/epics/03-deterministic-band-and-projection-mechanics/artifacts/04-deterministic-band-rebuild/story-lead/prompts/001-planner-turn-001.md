# Story 4: Deterministic Band Rebuild

### Summary
<!-- Jira: Summary field -->

Rebuild a draft Thread View from explicit per-run compaction inputs using deterministic full-fidelity, smooth, detailed, and brief allocation rules.

### Description
<!-- Jira: Description field -->

**User Profile**

Primary User: Context Steward. The steward manages a PI coding session whose source Thread continues to grow while the active Thread View approaches the runtime context ceiling. The steward needs deterministic, inspectable maintenance mechanics that can smooth turns, form chunks, rebuild Thread Views across all bands, and generate a shorter PI-compatible session file without requiring model work.

**Objective**

Deliver deterministic Thread View rebuild under explicit operator-supplied compaction inputs (lower-bound target and per-band allocation percentages). Full fidelity fills from newest raw Turns backward. Smooth fills from the next older eligible smooth Turns. Detailed and brief fill from closed Chunks with available placeholder representations. The result is a draft Thread View with a materialized emitted message sequence that lands at or below the requested lower-bound target, or reports explicit failure.

**Scope**

In scope:
- Accept explicit lower-bound target and per-band allocation percentages
- Reject invalid compaction inputs before allocation starts
- Full-fidelity band: newest Turns backward, no Turn splitting
- Full-fidelity overage reported explicitly when raw Turns alone exceed lower bound
- Smooth band: next older eligible smooth Turns, no Turn splitting
- Detailed and brief bands: closed Chunks only, open Chunk excluded
- Empty lower bands when no closed Chunks available
- Materialized emitted message sequence across all bands in band order
- Empty bands do not corrupt materialization
- Rebuild lands at or below lower-bound target, or failure is explicit
- Invalid band-allocation percentages rejected before allocation

Out of scope:
- Smart compact command orchestration (Story 5)
- PI-target file generation (Story 5)
- Blocked/degraded reporting infrastructure (Story 6)
- Persisted default compaction policies (future)

**Dependencies**

- Story 3 (closed Chunks with placeholder representations)
- Epic 2 ThreadViewStore for draft Thread View persistence

### Acceptance Criteria
<!-- Jira: Acceptance Criteria field -->

- **TC-4.1a: Rebuild accepts explicit lower-bound target and band mix**
  - Given: The operator provides a lower-bound target and per-band allocation percentages

- **TC-4.5b: Empty band does not corrupt materialization**
  - Given: One or more bands are empty
  - When: emitted messages are materialized
  - Then: the emitted sequence still materializes correctly from the non-empty bands

**AC-4.6:** The rebuilt draft Thread View targets the requested lower-bound input for that run.

- **TC-4.6a: Successful rebuild lands at or below lower threshold**
  - Given: Required source and placeholder artifacts are available and the operator has provided a lower-bound target
  - When: deterministic rebuild completes
  - Then: the resulting draft Thread View is at or below the requested lower-bound target
- **TC-4.6b: Failure to reach lower threshold is explicit**
  - Given: deterministic rebuild cannot reach the requested lower-bound target with the available mechanics
  - When: the rebuild completes or stops
  - Then: the failure is reported explicitly rather than hidden
- **TC-4.6c: Invalid band-allocation percentages are rejected explicitly**
  - Given: The operator provides an invalid band-allocation mix
  - When: deterministic rebuild starts
  - Then: the run is rejected explicitly before allocation proceeds

### Technical Design
<!-- Jira: Technical Notes or sub-section of Description -->

#### Architecture Context

This story is the center of the Feature 3 mechanics. It is where source Thread
state and derived async-thread artifacts become a new draft Thread View under
explicit compaction inputs. That makes it the bridge between the source-truth
side of the system and the runtime-facing side.

This story owns rebuild and materialization, but it does **not** own command
orchestration, PI-target file generation, or harness loading. It should stop at:
- choosing band selections
- validating lower-band eligibility
- materializing emitted messages
- persisting the rebuilt draft Thread View

#### Implementation Targets

| Area | Files / Modules |
|------|-----------------|
| Rebuild service | `src/thread-view/services/thread-view-builder.ts` |
| Materialization | `src/thread-view/services/thread-view-materializer.ts` |
| Thread View store updates | `src/thread-view/store/thread-view-store.ts`, `src/thread-view/store/file-thread-view-store.ts` |
| Source and derived-state reads | `src/thread/store/thread-store.ts`, `src/thread/async-thread/*` |

#### Test Mapping

| TC | Test File / Check | Test Description |
|----|-------------------|------------------|
| TC-4.1a | `tests/thread-view/thread-view-builder.test.ts` | rebuild accepts explicit run inputs |
| TC-4.1b | `tests/thread-view/thread-view-builder.test.ts` | rebuild rejects invalid run inputs |

| TC-4.6c | `tests/thread-view/thread-view-builder.test.ts` | invalid band percentages rejected before allocation |

#### Non-TC Decided Tests

- `tests/thread-view/thread-view-builder.test.ts`: lower-band selection rejects closed-chunk ids missing required persisted artifacts
- `tests/thread-view/thread-view-materializer.test.ts`: band order preserved when multiple middle or lower bands are empty

#### Technical Notes

The rebuild-specific contract is not fully described in the epic’s Data
Contracts section, so this story pulls the `ThreadViewBuildInputs` and
`ThreadViewBuildResult` contract from the tech design. That is the contract the
implementer actually needs here.

#### Anti-Shim Requirements

- Prove lower-band eligibility from real persisted chunk state, not from injected fake chunk summaries.
- Prove materialization from actual selected turns/chunks and band ordering, not from a canned emitted-message fixture.

#### Verification

- Targeted: `node --import tsx --test tests/thread-view/thread-view-builder.test.ts tests/thread-view/thread-view-materializer.test.ts`
- Story gate: `npm run verify`
- Epic gate: `npm run verify-all`

#### Spec Deviations

None.

### Definition of Done
<!-- Jira: Definition of Done or Acceptance Criteria footer -->

- [ ] All 15 TCs pass (TC-4.1a through TC-4.6c)
- [ ] Draft Thread Views persist with band selections and emitted messages
- [ ] `npm run verify` passes

# Test Plan: Deterministic Band And Projection Mechanics

## Purpose

This test plan maps every Test Condition from Epic 3 to a concrete test file
and behavior. It is the authoritative TC-to-test matrix for Feature 3.

Feature 3 currently has **67 epic TCs**. The count comes from:

- Flow 1: 8
- Flow 2: 11
- Flow 3: 8
- Flow 4: 15
- Flow 5: 15
- Flow 6: 10

This plan maps each TC to one primary test location. It also adds **12 non-TC
decided tests** for design risks that are not captured one-to-one in the epic.

The primary confidence layers are:

- service-mock tests over public entry points inside each surface
- integration tests over real file-backed state transitions
- E2E tests over the command-driven deterministic maintenance loop

Feature 3 is exactly the sort of interlocking lifecycle where E2E should not be
an afterthought. It still stays smaller than the service suite, but it must hit
the real seams.

## Test Architecture

Tests follow the service-mock philosophy:

- enter at public service or command boundaries
- exercise internal modules together
- mock only true external boundaries

For Feature 3, the “external boundary” usually means:

- filesystem faults or process-control seams
- PI CLI harness adapter behavior

The highest-value service and integration tests are still store-snapshot-driven:

- create a Thread with known Messages, Turns, and source metadata
- persist or omit smooth/chunk/placeholder artifacts intentionally
- create Thread Views with known selections when needed
- invoke the public service or command under test
- assert on persisted state transitions, emitted messages, PI-target files, or
  explicit blockers

## Mock And Fixture Strategy

Required fixture builders:

| Builder | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `makeThreadSnapshot()` | Canonical source Thread with Messages, Turns, and metadata |
| `makeSmoothTurnState()` | Deterministic smooth artifact fixture |
| `makeChunkState()` | Open/closed chunk lifecycle fixture |
| `makePlaceholderArtifactState()` | Detailed/brief placeholder fixture |
| `makeThreadView()` | Draft, active, or archived Thread View fixture |
| `makePiThreadViewFile()` | PI-target output fixture |
| `withTempThreadStore()` | Real temp root for thread + async-thread state |
| `withTempFeature3Store()` | Real temp root for thread + Thread View + PI-target output |

Mock boundaries:

| Boundary | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Canonical Thread store | Real temp directories for integration and E2E; fake only for unit tests if the unit is not about store behavior |
| Thread View store | Real temp directories for integration and E2E |
| PI CLI harness adapter | Mock in most service and integration tests; use a real adapter double in E2E |
| Filesystem failure paths | Mock or inject faultable writer at the file-writer boundary |
| Internal services | Do not mock across internal domain boundaries |

## Chunk Test Counts

Epic story estimates were directional. The test plan is the exact
reconciliation.

Chunk counts are by **story/AC ownership**, not purely by test-file location.
That matters for Feature 3 because some threshold-failure behavior from Story 6
is observed at the `smart-compact` command seam and therefore lives in
`tests/commands/smart-compact.test.ts` even though the owning ACs remain in
Chunk 6.

| Chunk | Primary TC Tests | Non-TC Tests | Total |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Chunk 0: Foundation and surface migration | 0 | 2 | 2 |
| Chunk 1: Deterministic smooth turns | 8 | 1 | 9 |
| Chunk 2: Deterministic chunk lifecycle | 11 | 1 | 12 |
| Chunk 3: Placeholder lower-fidelity outputs | 8 | 1 | 9 |
| Chunk 4: Deterministic Thread View rebuild and materialization | 15 | 2 | 17 |
| Chunk 5: Manual smart compact, PI-target output, archive, and PI load | 15 | 4 | 19 |
| Chunk 6: Blocked/degraded deterministic maintenance state and inspectability | 10 | 1 | 11 |
| Total | 67 | 12 | 79 |

### Chunk 0 Migration Verification

Chunk 0 includes real surface/name migration scaffolding. Even if the migration
is implemented incrementally or through compatibility re-exports, it needs a
regression gate beyond the 2 local non-TC tests:

- run the full existing Epic 1 + Epic 2 suites after the migration step
- require `npm run verify-all` to stay green before Feature 3 implementation
  proceeds

This is a gate requirement, not a new Epic 3 TC.

## Integration Tests

Feature 3 needs explicit integration coverage over real file-backed state. These
are additive to the 79 primary planned tests above.

| Test File | Focus |
|---|---|
| `tests/thread/thread-async.integration.test.ts` | smooth state, chunk lifecycle, and placeholder artifacts survive reopen and remain usable |
| `tests/thread-view/pi-thread-view-writer.integration.test.ts` | PI-target file write and archive behavior against real temp directories |
| `tests/commands/smart-compact.integration.test.ts` | command path runs over real thread + thread-view + PI-target stores with harness double |
| `tests/workbench/workbench-lower-band.integration.test.ts` | workbench lower-band inspection uses real chunk-backed persisted state |

## E2E Tests

Feature 3 E2E means:

- end-to-end through the full command and service stack
- against real file-backed Thread and Thread View state
- with a real PI CLI harness adapter double for automated runs
- plus optional manual dogfood against actual PI CLI after the automated gate

The E2E suite should stay smaller than the service suite, but it must cover the
real seams and meaningful edge cases.

Planned E2E scenarios:

1. first smart compact bootstraps deterministic artifacts from a fresh Thread
2. repeated smart compact archives prior PI-target output and loads the new one
3. invalid compaction inputs reject before any state mutation
4. open chunk remains out of lower bands during rebuild
5. missing smooth artifact blocks strict-mode compact explicitly
6. missing placeholder artifact blocks lower-band use explicitly
7. full-fidelity-only overage produces explicit degraded threshold result
8. placeholder lower-band output remains explicit in the written PI-target file
9. persisted smooth/chunk/placeholder state survives restart and a later compact run
10. successful PI-target write followed by PI load failure reports explicit reload failure while preserving the newly written target and archive outcome
11. prepare mode repairs missing deterministic artifacts on a non-fresh Thread and then completes compact successfully
12. failed compact leaves blocked or degraded state inspectable through normal read surfaces after the command returns

These can live in `tests/commands/smart-compact.e2e.test.ts` unless the suite
becomes large enough to split by scenario family.

### Deep-Gate Count

- 79 primary planned tests
- 4 integration tests
- 12 E2E tests
- 95 planned tests at the full deep gate when all suites exist

## Verification Commands

| Gate | Command | Expected Use |
|---|---|---|
| `red-verify` | `npm run red-verify` | After Red tests are written and expected to fail |
| `verify` | `npm run verify` | Standard development gate |
| `green-verify` | `npm run green-verify` | After implementation passes and test files remain unchanged |
| `verify-all` | `npm run verify-all` | Story completion and release-ready deep gate |

No prior runtime self-notes are recorded yet.

## Seeded Self-Note Example
Seeded first-turn instruction (not a prior runtime self-note): include `selfNote` when you want to leave a durable reminder for a later planner turn, for example `Track whether the next verifier pass still needs the ruling evidence.`

## State Rules
### state-rules
Bytes: 2986

Requirements source for story-local acceptance: the story file and test plan below.
Current lifecycle state: awaiting_story_lead_action

Lifecycle rules:
State: initialized
Public status: running
Allowed actions: none
Meaning: Runtime scaffolding exists, but no planner turn or child operation has started yet.
Caller implication: Treat this as startup bookkeeping only; wait for the first planner transition before routing work.

State: awaiting_story_lead_action
Public status: running
Allowed actions: run-implement, run-continue, run-self-review, run-verify, run-quick-fix, accept-story, request-ruling, block-story, fail-story
Meaning: The durable record is ready and the next fresh story-lead turn may choose one bounded action.
Caller implication: Planner output is the next source of truth; the run is waiting for a valid bounded action selection.

State: running_child_operation
Public status: running
Allowed actions: none
Meaning: The runtime is executing one bounded child operation selected by the story lead.
Caller implication: Poll runtime artifacts instead of rerouting; the current child operation is still in flight.

State: recording_result
Public status: running
Allowed actions: none
Meaning: The child result or terminal decision is being written to durable artifacts before the next transition.
Caller implication: Do not treat the run as advanced until evidence and ledger updates are durably recorded.

State: terminal
Public status: terminal-only
Allowed actions: none
Meaning: A terminal public outcome has been recorded separately from lifecycleState and the story-lead loop will not continue automatically.
Caller implication: Read the public status and final package to decide impl-lead follow-up such as accept, reopen, or ruling.

Terminal outcome rules:
Outcome: accepted
Meaning: Story-lead evidence is complete enough to recommend acceptance for impl-lead review.
Caller implication: Impl-lead still owes receipt completion, verification gates, and the story commit before accepting the story.

Outcome: needs-ruling
Meaning: The run reached a boundary that requires an explicit caller or maintainer decision.
Caller implication: Surface the ruling request instead of guessing or downgrading the decision into cleanup debt.

Outcome: blocked
Meaning: A named blocker prevents safe forward progress with the current inputs or runtime state.
Caller implication: Resolve the blocker or change the plan before resuming; do not pretend the story is ready to continue.

Outcome: failed
Meaning: An unrecoverable runtime or planner failure ended the current story-lead attempt.
Caller implication: Inspect the failure details and durable artifacts before deciding whether to replay or open a new attempt.

Outcome: interrupted
Meaning: The run stopped before a planned transition finished, usually because the caller or runtime interrupted it.
Caller implication: Use status or resume against the durable artifacts to continue from the last safe checkpoint.

## Runtime Settings
### runtime-settings
Bytes: 215

```yaml
storyGate: "npm run verify"
epicGate: "npm run verify-all"
plannerTimeoutMs: 600000
wholeRunTimeoutMs: 7200000
providerStartupTimeoutMs: 300000
providerActiveSilenceTimeoutMs: 600000
```

## Action Protocol
Return exactly one JSON object matching `StoryLeadAction`.

Examples:
{"action":"run-implement","rationale":"...","inputs":{"promptAddendum":"optional"},"selfNote":"optional durable reminder"}
{"action":"run-continue","rationale":"...","inputs":{"continuationRef":"storyImplementor","promptAddendum":"..."}}
{"action":"run-self-review","rationale":"...","inputs":{"artifactRefs":["/abs/path.json"],"focus":"optional","continuationRef":"storyImplementor","passes":1}}
{"action":"run-verify","rationale":"...","inputs":{"artifactRefs":["/abs/path.json"],"focus":"optional","provider":"codex"}}
{"action":"run-verify","rationale":"...","inputs":{"artifactRefs":["/abs/path.json"],"verifierContinuationRef":"storyVerifier","responseArtifactRef":"/abs/path.json"}}
{"action":"run-quick-fix","rationale":"...","inputs":{"findingRefs":["finding-001"],"remediationGoal":"...","workingDirectory":"optional"}}
{"action":"request-ruling","rationale":"...","inputs":{"decisionType":"...","question":"...","defaultRecommendation":"...","evidence":["..."],"allowedResponses":["..."]}}
{"action":"accept-story","rationale":"...","inputs":{"summary":"...","acceptanceCheckRefs":["..."],"acceptanceChecks":[{"name":"...","status":"pass","evidence":["..."],"reasoning":"..."}],"recommendedImplLeadAction":"accept"},"verification":{"finalVerifierOutcome":"pass","findings":[{"id":"...","status":"fixed","evidence":["..."]}]}}
{"action":"block-story","rationale":"...","inputs":{"reason":"...","detail":"optional","evidence":["..."]},"verification":{"finalVerifierOutcome":"block","findings":[{"id":"...","status":"unresolved","evidence":["..."]}]}}
{"action":"fail-story","rationale":"...","inputs":{"reason":"...","detail":"optional","evidence":["..."]}}

Rules:
- Choose exactly one bounded next action.
- Use only the durable story-run record in this prompt. Do not assume hidden retained planner memory exists.
- Treat `<current_response>` as the latest bounded child response and `<history_responses>` as older response history.
- If the story file and test plan are insufficient for a safe next step, request a ruling instead of asking for epic, tech design, git status, or git diff by default.
- Include `selfNote` only when you want to leave a durable reminder for a later planner turn.

## Acceptance Rubric
Choose the smallest safe bounded action that advances the story using the durable evidence already present.
Prefer continuing from valid child-operation evidence over repeating work, and keep unresolved authority-boundary questions explicit.

## Acceptance Decision Standard
Choose `accept-story` only when the latest verifier result is `pass`, no open findings remain, required proof is present, and the configured story gate passed.
If readiness is promising but gate truth is failed, unavailable, or uncertain, do not accept. Choose the smallest safe next action: verify, quick-fix, block, or request a ruling.

## Ruling Boundaries
Request a ruling when story-local requirements are insufficient, when a blocker needs a caller decision, or when the evidence conflicts in a way that the durable record cannot resolve safely.
